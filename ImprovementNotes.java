/**
 * IMPROVEMENT SUMMARY:
 * 
 * Our improvement focuses on two main areas:
 * 
 * 1. Grid Size Flexibility:
 *    - Modified the solver to handle different grid sizes (4x4, 9x9, 16x16)
 *    - Implemented character-to-integer conversion to support values beyond 9 (using A-F for 10-16)
 *    - Adjusted validation logic to work with any square grid size
 * 
 * 2. Algorithm Efficiency Improvements:
 *    - Added a "most constrained cell" heuristic to BFS to reduce the branching factor
 *    - This heuristic selects the empty cell with the fewest valid options to fill next
 *    - For DFS, we implemented a more efficient backtracking approach with early pruning
 * 
 * Performance Analysis:
 *    - For 4x4 puzzles: Both algorithms solve quickly, with negligible differences
 *    - For 9x9 puzzles: Our improved algorithms show significant speed improvements
 *    - For 16x16 puzzles: The improvements are critical for making the solution viable
 *      as standard BFS/DFS would consume too much memory or take too long
 * 
 * Limitations:
 *    - Still requires grid sizes to be perfect squares (4x4, 9x9, 16x16)
 *    - Memory usage grows significantly with larger grids
 *    - For extremely large grids (25x25+), additional optimizations would be needed
 * 
 * The most constrained cell heuristic is particularly effective because:
 *    - It reduces the branching factor of the search tree
 *    - Cells with fewer options are more likely to lead to constraints propagating
 *    - It mimics how humans solve Sudoku puzzles (looking for "forced moves")
